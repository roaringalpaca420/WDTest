Place your **watchdog image** here as `watchdog.png` (PNG with transparent or solid background).

- If `watchdog.png` is missing, the app uses a brown placeholder shape.
- For best results, use an image where the **eyes** and **mouth** are roughly at:
  - Left eye: ~35%, 38% from top-left
  - Right eye: ~65%, 38%
  - Mouth: ~45%–67%, ~62%–76%

You can tune these in `js/app.js` (`AVATAR_EYES_MOUTH`).
